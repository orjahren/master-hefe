# Rest API - performing LLM enhancement - Odin

- “Fast API”, Python
- Take a base test case as body
- Have some prompt repository
- Apply prompts with LLMs
- Must integrate with LLM. Either locally (Ollama) or remote (some API)
- Look into good LLM agnostic transition layer. E.g. Aisuite
- https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite
- Should use same UUIDs as outlined above, but suffixed with e.g. “pure” and “tainted”
- Containerized. Docker compose?
