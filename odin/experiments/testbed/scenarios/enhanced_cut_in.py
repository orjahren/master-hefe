1 - Context: We are working with a driving simulation environment for the Carla simulator. The goal is to increase the complexity and realism of a scenario where an ego vehicle is driving on a highway and another car is cutting in just in front.

2 - Task: Enhance the scenario by adding more vehicles, varying lane changes, dynamic traffic, and adjustable cut-in timing and distance.

3 - Input (with modifications):
