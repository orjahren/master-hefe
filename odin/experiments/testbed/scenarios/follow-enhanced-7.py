Enhanced Follow leading vehicle scenario:

The scenario realizes a common driving behavior, in which the
user-controlled ego vehicle follows a leading car driving down
a given road. This enhanced version introduces more complexity:
1. A pedestrian crosses the road in front of the leading vehicle, forcing it
   to react and slow down/stop unexpectedly.
2. A parked vehicle partially obstructs the road near the final stopping point,
   decreasing visibility and narrowing the path.
At some point, the leading car has to slow down and
finally stop. The ego vehicle has to react accordingly to avoid
a collision and navigate the increased complexity. The scenario ends either via a timeout, or if the ego
vehicle stopped close enough to the leading vehicle.
